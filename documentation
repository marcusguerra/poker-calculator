a program to help you in poker
Its a pretty straight foward program, divided in 5 parts,made in one week, and with the objective to help you in poker, note that this program wont decide anything or play the game for you, it just sugest what play you should do(note: the player individual skills are still the most important part of poker), and the odds of hitting that play.
  Part 1 - menu, its really easy to understand, there are 4 options: 1- start a new game,2-help(show how to type the cards, the power of the cards and the power of the combinations), 3 - credits(note: i wrote the hole program solo so consider following me on twitter for any questions and suggestions @marcao137),0 - exit.
  Part 2 - openning hand, wich you just type your 2 first cards and the program tells your hand tier and if you should play it or not(note: the code always plays really really safe, so consider playing a tier 8 hand now and then)
  Part 3 - flop,you type the three community cards given, and the program tells you what you have in hand,what can beat your hand, the odds of you hitting an flush or a straight(note: the straight does not work when its given an Ace and a 2, long story short i didnt have enought time to fix it) and when it finishes give you the option to repeat the turn(in case you typed a wrong card) or advance)
  Part 4 - turn, its basically does the same as the flop, but the input its just one card, and our outs for some combinations are diferent
  Part 5 - river, you write the last card, and it tells you what are your combos and what can beat you, then gives you the options to finish your game or to repeat the river.
  There are still a lot to be implemented and minor bugs to be fixed but, when i have the time, the knowledge and the will to do it, i will probably do.
